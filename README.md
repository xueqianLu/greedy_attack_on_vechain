# The Greedy Attack Against the VeChainThor Proof-of-Authority Consensus Protocol Repo

This is the repository of the paper "The Greedy Attack Against the VeChainThor Proof-of-Authority Consensus Protocol".
The repository implements the modified Vechain thor protocol and attacks shown in the paper.

# Ethical Considerations
Our experiments are launched using local testnet (using one local machine). No experiments are conducted on the live VeChain network.

# Hardware dependencies
The experiments do not require particular hardware. The configuration of our computer is as follows: 32-core CPU, 64 GB RAM, 500GB SSD, and a 100 Mbps bandwidth.

# Software dependencies
We ran our experiments using Docker, which can be installed following the instructions of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). The version of the Docker Engine is at v20.10.17.

# Experiments
We have uploaded a portion of the experimental data used in the paper at `experiments` directory, but due to the large volume of data, we are unable to upload the entire dataset. If you need the complete dataset, please contact us.
